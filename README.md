# Projects
* A* Algorithms
    * Done in collaboration with Ethan Chang
    * Implements Forward A*, Backward A*, and Adaptive A*
* Alpha-Beta Search
    * Implemented a Depth-Limited Alpha-Beta Search for a Connect k game (similar to Connect 4 but connecting k pieces)
* Brushfire and GVD
    * Implements Brushfire on a grid to construct a Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD)
    * Constructs a pathway between a start and goal using the GVD
* Bug Algorithm
    * Implements the Bug 2 algorithm
* CNN with Attention and Siamese NN
    * Done in collaboration with Daniel Boehm and Alex Karlovitz
    * Generated models capable of identifying company logos from screenshots
    * Implements an Attention-Augmented Convolutional Neural Network and a Siamese Neural Network
* DIRT vs. RRT
    * Done in collaboration with Liang Hu, Tian Xie, and Weiran Wang
    * Implements the Dominance Informed Region Tree (DIRT) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms for purposes of comparison
    * These algorithms were performed in a scenario where the robots had limited information of their environment

    * Implements Hill Climbing Search to solve Sudoku
* Learned Inverse Kinematics
    * Implements a Neural Network to learn the inverse position kinematics for a RRR manipulator
* Naive Bayes Classifier
    * Done in collaboration with Ethan Chang
    * Implements Naive Bayes from scratch to identify Arabian numerals
* Q Learning
    * Implements Q learning to solved for the optimal policy when playing Blackjack
* RRT Algorithms
    * Implements the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (RRT) along with a greedy version
    * Done for a RR arm which has a Non-Euclidean configuration space
* Word Ladder Search
    * Implements Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* to solve Word Ladder puzzles
